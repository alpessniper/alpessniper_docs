## Overview

**Wallet Signals** are generated when tracked high-performance wallets interact with tokens. This section shows you what experienced traders are doing.

<Info>
  Requires **Plus** tier or higher subscription.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. We track wallets with proven trading performance
2. When these wallets buy or interact with tokens, we generate signals
3. You see the same opportunities that experienced traders are taking

## What You'll See

Each wallet signal shows:
- Token information (symbol, name, contract)
- Entry metrics (market cap, volume, holders)
- Wallet backing information
- Performance tracking

## Smart Money Categories

Our tracked wallets include:
- High win-rate traders
- Early token discoverers
- Consistent performers

<Note>
  Wallet addresses are not disclosed to protect our methodology and prevent front-running.
</Note>

## Important Considerations

<Warning>
  Wallet signals show you what experienced traders are doing, but this doesn't guarantee success. Smart money traders can also have losing trades.
</Warning>

**Remember:**
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Do your own research on every token
- Use proper position sizing
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose
