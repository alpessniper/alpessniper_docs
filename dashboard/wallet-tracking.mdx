## Overview

**Wallet Signals** (Signals by Wallet) are generated when our tracked high-performance wallets interact with tokens. These are wallets we monitor based on their proven trading performance.

<Info>
  Requires **Plus** tier or higher subscription.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. **We track** wallets with proven trading performance (Smart Money)
2. When these wallets buy or interact with tokens, we generate signals
3. You see opportunities that experienced traders are taking

## What You'll See

Each wallet signal shows:
- Token information (symbol, name, contract)
- Entry metrics (market cap, volume, holders)
- Smart Money backing indicators
- Performance tracking over time

## Smart Money Categories

Our tracked wallets include:
- High win-rate traders
- Early token discoverers
- Consistent performers

<Note>
  Wallet addresses are not disclosed to protect our methodology and prevent front-running.
</Note>

## Important Considerations

<Warning>
  Wallet signals show you what experienced traders are doing, but this doesn't guarantee success. Smart money traders can also have losing trades.
</Warning>

**Remember:**
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Do your own research on every token
- Use proper position sizing
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose
