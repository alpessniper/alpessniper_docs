## What is a Signal?

A **signal** is an alert that a token has met certain criteria indicating potential trading opportunity. Alpes Sniper continuously monitors the Solana blockchain and delivers signals when tokens qualify based on our analysis.

## Signal Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discovery">
    Our system detects a token that meets initial criteria
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    The token passes through multiple validation layers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Signal Generation">
    A signal is created with entry metrics captured
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delivery">
    Signal appears on your dashboard in real-time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tracking">
    Performance is tracked and ATH (All-Time High) recorded
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Metrics Explained

### Market Cap (MCAP)

Market cap represents the total value of all tokens in circulation.

- **MCAP Entry** - The market cap when the signal was generated
- **Current MCAP** - The live market cap
- **MCAP ATH** - The highest market cap reached after the signal

<Info>
  ROI is calculated as: `(Current MCAP / Entry MCAP) - 1`
</Info>

### Volume 24h

The total trading volume in the last 24 hours. Higher volume generally indicates:
- More interest in the token
- Better liquidity for trading
- More active community

### Holders

The number of unique wallet addresses holding the token. Consider:
- Growth rate (increasing holders = healthy sign)
- Distribution (avoid tokens with few large holders)

### Liquidity

The amount of assets in the trading pool. Higher liquidity means:
- Easier to buy and sell
- Less price slippage
- More stable prices

### Age

Time since the token was created:
- **< 48h** - Very new, higher risk/reward
- **3-7 days** - Establishing market presence
- **7-30 days** - Building track record
- **30+ days** - Established token

## Signal Quality Indicators

### DEX Paid

Tokens marked as "DEX Paid" have purchased enhanced token information on DEX platforms. This typically indicates:
- Team is investing in visibility
- More likely to be a serious project
- Enhanced token page with logo, description, socials

### Social Links

Presence of verified social channels (Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Website) can indicate:
- Active community
- Team transparency
- Ongoing development

<Warning>
  Social presence alone doesn't guarantee legitimacy. Always do your own research.
</Warning>

## Performance Tracking

After a signal is generated, we track:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ROI** | Return on investment from entry price |
| **ATH ROI** | Best return achieved (at all-time high) |
| **Time to ATH** | How long it took to reach peak |
| **Current Status** | Active, Dead, or Rugged |

### Signal Outcomes

- **Winner (2x+)** - Token achieved 2x or higher from entry
- **Active** - Token still trading, not yet 2x
- **Dead** - Token dropped significantly and hasn't recovered
- **Rugged** - Token was abandoned or liquidity removed
