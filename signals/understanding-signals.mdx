## What is a Signal?

A **signal** is an alert that a token has met certain criteria indicating potential trading opportunity. Alpes Sniper continuously monitors the Solana blockchain and delivers signals when tokens qualify based on our analysis.

## Two Discovery Methods

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Signals by Engine" icon="gear">
    Tokens discovered by analyzing market metrics (age, volume, liquidity, holders). Smart Money data is used only to **enrich information**, not to identify the token.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Signals by Wallet" icon="wallet">
    Tokens discovered by monitoring Smart Money wallets. We detect buy/sell swaps and apply filters - only tokens that **pass our filters** become signals.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Key difference:** Engine signals find tokens first, then add Smart Money data. Wallet signals start from Smart Money activity and filter from there.

## Signal Lifecycle

### Signals by Engine

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discovery">
    System scans blockchain for tokens matching market criteria
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    Token passes through multiple validation layers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Enrichment">
    Smart Money data is added for additional context (not used for discovery)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Signal Generation">
    Signal is created with entry metrics captured
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delivery">
    Signal appears on your dashboard in real-time
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Signals by Wallet

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wallet Monitoring">
    System monitors tracked Smart Money wallets in real-time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Swap Detection">
    Buy or sell swap is detected from a tracked wallet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter Application">
    Token must pass our filters to qualify as a signal
  </Step>
  <Step title="Signal Generation">
    Only tokens that pass filters become signals
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delivery">
    Signal appears on your dashboard in real-time
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Metrics Explained

### Market Cap (MCAP)

Market cap represents the total value of all tokens in circulation.

- **MCAP Entry** - The market cap when the signal was generated
- **Current MCAP** - The live market cap
- **MCAP ATH** - The highest market cap reached after the signal

<Info>
  ROI is calculated as: `(Current MCAP / Entry MCAP) - 1`
</Info>

### Volume 24h

The total trading volume in the last 24 hours. Higher volume generally indicates:
- More interest in the token
- Better liquidity for trading
- More active community

### Holders

The number of unique wallet addresses holding the token. Consider:
- Growth rate (increasing holders = healthy sign)
- Distribution (avoid tokens with few large holders)

### Liquidity

The amount of assets in the trading pool. Higher liquidity means:
- Easier to buy and sell
- Less price slippage
- More stable prices

### Age

Time since the token was created:
- **< 48h** - Very new, higher risk/reward
- **3-7 days** - Establishing market presence
- **7-30 days** - Building track record
- **30+ days** - Established token

## Signal Quality Indicators

### DEX Paid

Tokens marked as "DEX Paid" have purchased enhanced token information on DEX platforms. This typically indicates:
- Team is investing in visibility
- More likely to be a serious project
- Enhanced token page with logo, description, socials

### Social Links

Presence of verified social channels (Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Website) can indicate:
- Active community
- Team transparency
- Ongoing development

<Warning>
  Social presence alone doesn't guarantee legitimacy. Always do your own research.
</Warning>

### Smart Money Backing (Engine Signals)

For Engine signals, we show if Smart Money wallets hold the token:
- This is **informational only** - not used for signal discovery
- Shows number of tracked wallets holding
- Adds confidence but is not the selection criteria

## Performance Tracking

After a signal is generated, we track:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ROI** | Return on investment from entry price |
| **ATH ROI** | Best return achieved (at all-time high) |
| **Time to ATH** | How long it took to reach peak |
| **Current Status** | Active, Dead, or Rugged |

### Signal Outcomes

- **Winner (2x+)** - Token achieved 2x or higher from entry
- **Active** - Token still trading, not yet 2x
- **Dead** - Token dropped significantly and hasn't recovered
- **Rugged** - Token was abandoned or liquidity removed

## Best Practices

    Not every signal requires immediate action. Evaluate based on your strategy.

  <Card title="Manage Risk" icon="shield">
    Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use position sizing.

  <Card title="Do Your Research" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Signals are starting points. Verify socials, check holders, review code.
