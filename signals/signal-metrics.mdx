## Market Metrics

### Market Cap (MCAP)

The total market value of a token's circulating supply.

```
Market Cap = Current Price × Circulating Supply
```

**On Alpes Sniper:**
- **MCAP Entry** - Market cap when signal was generated
- **Current MCAP** - Live market cap (updates periodically)
- **MCAP ATH** - Highest market cap reached after signal

<Tip>
  Compare Entry MCAP vs Current MCAP to quickly assess performance.
</Tip>

---

### Liquidity

The total value of assets in the token's trading pool(s).

**Why it matters:**
- Higher liquidity = easier to trade
- Low liquidity = high slippage risk
- Indicates trading activity level

<Warning>
  Be cautious with very low liquidity tokens - you may not be able to sell at expected prices.
</Warning>

---

### Volume 24h

Total trading volume in the last 24 hours.

**Indicators:**
- High volume = active trading interest
- Sudden volume spikes may indicate news or manipulation
- Declining volume may indicate waning interest

---

### Holders

Number of unique wallet addresses holding the token.

**Consider:**
- Growing holders = healthy sign
- Rapid holder growth at launch = potential early interest
- Declining holders = possible concern

---

## Token Information

### Age

Time since the token contract was deployed.

| Age | Classification |
|-----|----------------|
| < 24h | Very New |
| 24-48h | New |
| 3-7 days | Emerging |
| 7-30 days | Established |
| 30+ days | Mature |

---

### Contract Address

The unique identifier for the token on Solana blockchain.

<Note>
  Always verify the contract address before trading. Scammers create fake tokens with similar names.
</Note>

---

## Status Indicators

### DEX Paid

Token has purchased enhanced information on DEX platforms (like DexScreener).

**What it means:**
- Team invested in visibility
- Token page has logo, description, links
- Often indicates more serious project

<Info>
  DEX Paid is a positive signal but doesn't guarantee project legitimacy.
</Info>

---

### Social Links

Verified social media presence:

| Platform | What to Check |
|----------|---------------|
| **Twitter** | Activity, followers, engagement |
| **Telegram** | Community size, activity level |
| **Discord** | Community health, team responsiveness |
| **Website** | Professionalism, documentation |

---

## Performance Metrics

### ROI (Return on Investment)

Percentage return from entry price.

```
ROI = ((Current MCAP / Entry MCAP) - 1) × 100%
```

**Examples:**
- Entry: $100K → Current: $200K = **100% ROI (2x)**
- Entry: $100K → Current: $500K = **400% ROI (5x)**
- Entry: $100K → Current: $50K = **-50% ROI**

---

### ATH ROI

The best ROI achieved (at All-Time High market cap).

<Tip>
  ATH ROI shows the maximum opportunity the signal provided, even if current price is lower.
</Tip>

---

### Time to ATH

How long after the signal was generated until the token reached its ATH.

**Patterns:**
- Quick ATH (< 24h) = momentum play
- Gradual ATH (days/weeks) = organic growth
- No ATH reached = signal didn't perform

---

## Signal Status

### Active

Token is still trading and hasn't met criteria for other statuses.

### Winner

Token achieved **2x or higher** from entry market cap.

### Dead

Token has dropped significantly and shows no recovery signs:
- Very low market cap
- Minimal trading activity

- Liquidity removed

<Warning>
  Dead and Rugged tokens should be avoided. These statuses help you learn from past signals.
</Warning>
