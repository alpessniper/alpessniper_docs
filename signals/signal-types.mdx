description: "Learn about the different types of signals on Alpes Sniper"
---

## Overview

Alpes Sniper provides signals through three main discovery methods, plus Premium signals for high-conviction opportunities.

<Info>
  **Important:** Each discovery method uses different criteria. Understanding these differences helps you choose signals that match your trading style.
</Info>

---

## Signals by Engine

Engine signals discover tokens by analyzing **market metrics** (age, volume, liquidity, holders).

<Warning>
  Smart Money data is used only to **enrich information** on these signals - it is NOT used to identify or select the tokens.
</Warning>

The discovery is based purely on token characteristics. After a token qualifies, we add Smart Money data to show if any tracked wallets hold it - this is informational context, not selection criteria.

### Token NEW

<Info>
  Tokens between **0-48 hours** old
</Info>

These are the freshest token launches. Characteristics:
- Highest potential risk and reward
- Early discovery opportunity
- Requires quick decision making
- Best for experienced traders

**Best for:** Traders looking to catch tokens at launch

---

### Tokens >3D

<Info>
  Tokens **3-7 days** old
</Info>

Tokens that have survived the initial launch phase:
- Initial volatility has settled
- Early community forming
- Trading patterns emerging
- More data available for analysis

**Best for:** Balanced risk/reward seekers

---

### Tokens >7D

<Info>
  Tokens **7-30 days** old
</Info>

Tokens establishing market presence:
- More stable price action
- Clearer community trajectory
- Better liquidity typically
- Historical data to analyze

**Best for:** Moderate risk traders

---

### Tokens >30D

<Info>
  Tokens **30+ days** old
</Info>

Established tokens with proven track record:
- Survived multiple market cycles
- Stronger community typically
- More predictable patterns
- Lower risk, potentially lower reward

**Best for:** Conservative traders seeking stability

---

## Signals by Wallet

Wallet signals use a completely different approach - **Smart Money wallets are the source of discovery**.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wallet Monitoring">
    We continuously monitor tracked Smart Money wallets in real-time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Swap Detection">
    When a tracked wallet makes a buy or sell swap, we detect it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter Application">
    The token goes through our filters for quality validation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Signal Publication">
    **Only tokens that pass our filters become signals** - not every swap is published
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Not every Smart Money swap becomes a signal. We apply filters to select only the best opportunities.
</Warning>

### Why This Matters

  <Card title="Curated Quality" icon="filter">
    Filters ensure you see quality opportunities, not every transaction
  </Card>
  <Card title="Proven Traders" icon="wallet">
    Tracked wallets have demonstrated trading performance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-Time" icon="bolt">
    Swaps are detected and processed in real-time
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Confirmation" icon="users">
    Some tokens have backing from multiple tracked wallets
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  These are wallets **we** track based on performance. For tracking your **own** wallets, see [Wallet Tracking](/dashboard/wallet-tracking-feature).
</Note>

## Signals by Volume

### Tokens High Mcap

High market cap tokens with significant trading volume.

<Info>
  Established tokens with substantial market presence
</Info>

**Characteristics:**
- Higher market capitalization
- Significant trading volume
- Better liquidity
- Lower volatility typically

**Best for:** Traders seeking lower-risk opportunities in established tokens

---

## Premium Signals

<Warning>
  Premium tier subscription required
</Warning>

Premium signals are **high-conviction opportunities** that meet additional criteria:

- Stronger validation metrics
- Multiple positive indicators aligned
- Higher confidence scoring

Premium signals appear across all categories with a special badge.

---

## Feature: Wallet Tracking

<Info>
  This is a **personal monitoring feature**, not a signal type.
</Info>

Wallet Tracking lets you monitor up to **5 wallets** of your choice:
- You choose which wallets to track
- System monitors in **near real-time**
- Alerts you on buy/sell swaps
- No filters applied - you see all activity

**See:** [Wallet Tracking Feature](/dashboard/wallet-tracking-feature)
