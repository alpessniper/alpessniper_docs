## Signals

  <Accordion title="How fast are signals delivered?">
    Most signals are delivered within 15 seconds of meeting our criteria. Premium users get the fastest delivery.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between signal types?">
    - **Signals by Engine**: Based on token age (NEW, >3D, >7D, >30D)
    - **Signals by Wallet**: From tracked Smart Money wallets
    - **Signals by Volume**: High market cap tokens with volume
    - **Premium Signals**: High-conviction curated opportunities
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does 'Winner' mean?">
    A signal is marked as a Winner when the token reaches **2x or higher** from its entry market cap.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does 'Dead' mean?">
    A token is marked as Dead when it has dropped significantly (typically below $15K market cap) with no recovery.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does 'Rugged' mean?">
    A token is marked as Rugged when liquidity was removed or the project was abandoned by the team.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why don't all signals succeed?">
    Cryptocurrency is highly volatile. Not every opportunity succeeds. Our signals indicate potential, not guaranteed returns. Use proper risk management.
